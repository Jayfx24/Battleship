## About

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic board game **Battleship**, created as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum.

Players can place ships, take turns guessing locations or play against **AI**, and experience interactive gameplay enhanced with sound effects.

The project emphasizes **JavaScript logic**, **DOM manipulation**, **testing** and **event-driven programming**, making it a great showcase of web development fundamentals.

## Features

- **Player vs Player:** Take turns against another human player.
- **Player vs Bot:** Challenge an AI opponent for a solo experience.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Clickable game board for firing shots.
- **Analytics:** Track ship health and view detailed impact locations for both your ships and the enemyâ€™s.
- **Audio Effects:** Enjoy sound effects for every action and event.
- **Ship Placement:** Manually place your ships on the board (desktop/PC only).
- **Ship Rotation:** Click on ships to rotate them before starting the game.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Implements game logic, DOM manipulation, and interactive elements.  
- **HTML5:** Provides the structure and content of the game.  
- **CSS:** Handles styling, layout, and responsive design.  
- **Webpack:** Bundles JavaScript modules for optimized delivery.  
- **Jest:** Performs testing of JavaScript code to ensure reliability.
